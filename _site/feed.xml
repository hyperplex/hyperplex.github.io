				<title>An iPhone Microscope to Help Eradicate River Blindness</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;iPhone camera and microscope lenses is sure not an apple to apple comparison but when you trap in the middle of sub-Saharan Africa, you can use you iPhone to help diagnose people with &lt;a href=&quot;http://eol.org/pages/2924222/overview&quot;&gt;Loa-loa, an eyeworm&lt;/a&gt; which causes river blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iOS 9 and Safari View Controller: The Future of Web Views</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Federico Viticci on Macstories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With Safari View Controller, Apple is freeing many developers from the burden of writing browser components for their apps. “This is something developers have been asking for for years”, Milham told me, and it’s not hard to understand why. If an app’s primary functionality isn’t to display web content but still needs to occasionally present webpages, having to code a browser from scratch is a waste of precious time in most cases. Safari View Controller fixes this by bringing years of Safari evolution to every app. This is good for developers, who won’t need to spend hours writing a decent browser from the ground up, and it’s good for users, who will be able to rely on the power of Safari almost anywhere on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is worth to read.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>BlackBerry adds private chat feature to BBM on iOS and Android</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From The Next Web:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where BlackBerry used to offer a ‘Timed and Retracted Control’ subscription, there’s now a Privacy and Control subscription that costs $0.99 per month. In addition to providing the timed sending and retraction of messages options, the plan also includes the new private chat feature and another new feature that allows you to edit a sent message by retracting it, editing it and then re-sending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what it is, I guess they are trying so hard to make profit from its instant messaging services.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Create Linked Blog Post On The Go With Workflow</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Before I run this site on Jekyll I’ve tried many blogging platform like Tumblr, self-hosted Wordpress, to Octopress, a static site generator based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a great thing about static site generator, all you have to do is write the post in plain text markdown formatted file and fill all the yaml front-matter as your post metadata. You can write any post from an iPhone, iPad as long as you follow the formatting you’ve set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also published linked post from an article I find interesting around the web and since I mostly spend my time using my iPhone and iPad I need to automate the linked post creation. Sure, all of you who using iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch have heard about Workflow. Workflow is an app that can automate things on iOS. Using this, you can automate mundane task on iOS such as combining screenshot, journaling, to cross-posting content to all of your social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides using &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=1010lDx&amp;amp;ct=aditya&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt;, I also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=1010lDx&amp;amp;ct=trl&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; to edit the linked post before I publish it. Drafts is where text starts from iOS and you could send them anywhere. With the keyboard actions overmore, you can manipulate the text you write such as make it uppercase or titlecase without hassle. Workflow and Drafts are the must-have apps on your iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So combining those two apps, I could make a linked post in a minute. So, here’s the magic of the Workflow apps, I built a workflow as an action extension that takes URL from Safari as an input. From the URL input, the workflow will put the title page, url and selected text into variables which is used to fill the yaml front-matter. In Jekyll, the post you write have to save in certain formatted date and hyphenated words which will become the post URL. Using Workflow’s date actions and combine text I’m able to get this done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end of the workflow, I have “add to Drafts” actions that will create a draft with linked post format for this site. From there I just need send it to my Dropbox and deploy it to my web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the screenshot of the workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/linked-post-workflow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Linked Post Workflow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Jekyll or any other static site generator you can tweak the workflow to suit your needs. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/29f8e16f05e44fa68c8ade64ff628842&quot;&gt;get it here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this workflow, I can linked any articles wherever without worrying I don’t bring my Macbook.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iOS 9 Allows Users to Temporarily Delete Apps to Free Up Space for Software Updates</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Beasley writings for 9to5Mac:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This new feature will allow the operating system to intelligently delete applications if you don’t have enough free space to perform a software update. Once the update is complete, the apps will automatically be reinstalled and your data will remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s glad to hear this and know that Apple is still responsible for selling 16GB iOS device and make it less painful to use.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Apple receives praise from the EFF for its transparency regarding user data</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From 9to5Mac:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apple this year has received praise from the EFF for how transparent it is when it comes to handling requests form government agencies and standing up for user rights and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good guy, Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Web is getting its bytecode: WebAssembly</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;ArsTechnica has detailed information about WebAssembly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, or wasm for short, is intended to be a portable bytecode that will be efficient for browsers to download and load, providing a more efficient target for compilers than plain JavaScript or even asm.js. Like, for example, .NET bytecode, wasm instructions operate on native machine types such as 32-bit integers, enabling efficient compilation. It’s also designed to be extensible, to make it easy to add, say, support for SIMD instruction sets like SSE and AVX.
WebAssembly will include both a binary notation, that compilers will produce, and a corresponding text notation, suitable for display in debuggers or development environments. Early prototypes are already showing some of the expected advantages; the binary representation is 20 times faster to parse than the equivalent asm.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>San Francisco Fonts Are Now Available To Download</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple’s San Francisco fonts are now available to download for developers. They can now start to update their apps to include these fonts. This font is nicer than Helvetica Neue and I say so because I’ve used it on my jailbroken iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=804&quot;&gt;watch the video introduction here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
