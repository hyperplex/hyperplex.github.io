			<h1><a href="/articles/2015/07/02/sometimes-you-only-need-one-hammer-sublime-text-for-blogging-with-jekyll/">Sometimes You Only Need One Hammer, Sublime Text for Blogging With Jekyll</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’ve tried many blogging platform before and I’ve impressed with static site generators. I’ve tried Octopress before finally end up using Jekyll to serve this blog. All you have to do is write and let the command build the site. Of course there’s a learning curve before because when you start blogging using <a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/">static site generators</a>, you need to be friend with command line.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of text editors you can use to write on Mac or Windows or any operating system platform you use. But there isn’t one like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. Sublime Text is versatile crossed platform text based on Python API. It support various syntax of programming languanges and overmore you can expand its functionality to do other task with plugins.</p>

<p>$70 is the investement you need to own Sublime Text even you can use it free. Trust me it’s worth the money. Talk about blogging with Jekyll, I barely left Sublime Text when writing a new post. From creating markdown file until published it in my hosting site, I only need Sublime Text.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll">Sublime-Jekyll</a> plugins to create new posts, new drafts and move my drafts queue into my post folder. It’s handy when you can create a new post just with keyboard shortcut Command+K and Command+P. To build Jekyll site, you need to run <code>jekyll serve</code> in your terminal but the best things is you can build your Jekyll site inside Sublime Text. I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/EldonMcGuinness/53b7eab7fbebd6be9b36">a gist in Github</a> that can run <code>jekyll build</code> to build your site and output the result to the console.</p>

<p><img src="/images/st2.png" alt="Sublime Jekyll New Post" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/st1.png" alt="Sublime Jekyll Build" /></p>

<p>The last thing to complete the workflow is SFTP plugins. I use it to upload the entire site to my hosting site. You need to configure the path and the host address before.</p>

<p>With this workflow, Sublime Text eliminates around 3 apps I’ve used to blog. I don’t need Filezilla to upload to my site, I don’t need another text editor cause you can customize Sublime Text to suitable to your liking. Sublime Text is once again a versatile text editor. You can use it many ways and even as a <a href="http://technologynotes.net/blog/one-hammer-task-management">task manager</a> to nailed it all.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Federico Viticci on Macstories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Safari View Controller, Apple is freeing many developers from the burden of writing browser components for their apps. “This is something developers have been asking for for years”, Milham told me, and it’s not hard to understand why. If an app’s primary functionality isn’t to display web content but still needs to occasionally present webpages, having to code a browser from scratch is a waste of precious time in most cases. Safari View Controller fixes this by bringing years of Safari evolution to every app. This is good for developers, who won’t need to spend hours writing a decent browser from the ground up, and it’s good for users, who will be able to rely on the power of Safari almost anywhere on iOS.</p>

			<h1><a href="/article/2015/06/27/create-linked-blog-post-on-the-go-with-workflow/">Create Linked Blog Post On The Go With Workflow</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>Before I run this site on Jekyll I’ve tried many blogging platform like Tumblr, self-hosted Wordpress, to Octopress, a static site generator based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. There’s a great thing about static site generator, all you have to do is write the post in plain text markdown formatted file and fill all the yaml front-matter as your post metadata. You can write any post from an iPhone, iPad as long as you follow the formatting you’ve set up.</p>

<p>I also published linked post from an article I find interesting around the web and since I mostly spend my time using my iPhone and iPad I need to automate the linked post creation. Sure, all of you who using iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch have heard about Workflow. Workflow is an app that can automate things on iOS. Using this, you can automate mundane task on iOS such as combining screenshot, journaling, to cross-posting content to all of your social media accounts.</p>

<p>Besides using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lDx&amp;ct=aditya">Workflow</a>, I also use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010lDx&amp;ct=trl">Drafts</a> to edit the linked post before I publish it. Drafts is where text starts from iOS and you could send them anywhere. With the keyboard actions overmore, you can manipulate the text you write such as make it uppercase or titlecase without hassle. Workflow and Drafts are the must-have apps on your iOS devices.</p>

<p>So combining those two apps, I could make a linked post in a minute. So, here’s the magic of the Workflow apps, I built a workflow as an action extension that takes URL from Safari as an input. From the URL input, the workflow will put the title page, url and selected text into variables which is used to fill the yaml front-matter. In Jekyll, the post you write have to save in certain formatted date and hyphenated words which will become the post URL. Using Workflow’s date actions and combine text I’m able to get this done.</p>

<p>In the end of the workflow, I have “add to Drafts” actions that will create a draft with linked post format for this site. From there I just need send it to my Dropbox and deploy it to my web server.</p>

<p>Here’s the screenshot of the workflow:</p>

<p><img src="/images/linked-post-workflow.png" alt="Linked Post Workflow" /></p>

<p>If you use Jekyll or any other static site generator you can tweak the workflow to suit your needs. You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/29f8e16f05e44fa68c8ade64ff628842">get it here</a></p>

<p>With this workflow, I can linked any articles wherever without worrying I don’t bring my Macbook.</p>

<p>It’s glad to hear this and know that Apple is still responsible for selling 16GB iOS device and make it less painful to use.</p>
