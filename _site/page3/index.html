		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple has released a support documentation about two-factor authentication that will be built in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whenever you sign in with your Apple ID on a new device or browser, you will verify your identity by entering your password plus a six-digit verification code. The verification code will be displayed automatically on any Apple devices you are already signed in to that are running iOS 9 or OS X El Capitan. Just enter the code to complete sign in. If you don’t have an Apple device handy, you can receive the code on your phone via a text message or phone call instead.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re an iOS user, you’ve already know that when you select some text there will be a tiny pop-up with various menu that usually let you cut, copy, define or even speak that selected text. In iOS mail app the pop-up menu also lets you insert a photo or attachment. In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;at=1010lDx&amp;ct=hy">Drafts</a>, you can look up for a word you select in Terminology if installed using the pop-up menu. However when working on Mac, there’s no such functionality you can use by default. But don’t worry, there’s an app for that, it’s called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/popclip/id445189367?at=1010lDx">PopClip</a></p>

<p>PopClip mimic pop-up action menu on iOS. So after you install PopClip and select some text, there will be a pop-up menu that allow you to do various task with your selected text. You can save your selected text on Evernote, nvALT. If you’re have an appointment on your email, you can select and send it to Fantastical. Where does this magic live?</p>

<p>There are extensions that make PopClip powerful. PopClip has <a href="http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions">hundreds extensions</a> from manipulating text, translate it, count the words from selected text till make a new to do task on Todoist<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> or any task management apps you use. If you can’t find one, why you’re not <a href="https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions">build for yourself?</a>. Here’s the screenshot of PopClip extensions I use:</p>

<p><img src="/images/popclip.png" alt="PopClip extensions" /></p>

<p>With <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/popclip/id445189367?at=1010lDx">$3.99</a> asking price (for a limited time), PopClip is tiny app that will speed up your workflow on Mac.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>“If it’s not an iPhone, it’s not an iPhone” is the new slogan for two Apple’s ads that has been released today. The two ads titled with Hardware &amp; Software and Loved. The first ad, Apple explain how they can control and optimize their product because they created both hardware and software, the latter of course the impact to the user satisfaction.</p>

<p>User experience isn’t just about software. Hardware also play important role to create the whole experience. The question is, what is Apple? A hardware or software company?</p>

  <p>Where financially possible, people also trade money for time. We hire assistants, maids, secretaries, gardeners, and babysitters. These are very common and legitimate money-for-time trades. We also buy products to save us time: microwaves, espresso machines, clothes dryers…</p>

  <p>So why don’t we “hire” apps for the same purpose? Among the people I know, there aren’t many whose time (and money) couldn’t be better utilized with a simple automation trick or a dirt-cheap app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I buy apps and sometimes my friends ask me why I waste my money to such an app that can be replaced with post-it or agenda which I get every year from my office. I just smile. Now when someone ask me the same question again, I’ll just send them this link.</p>

			<h1><a href="/article/2015/07/moving-to-duckduckgo/">Moving to DuckDuckGo</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>There are choices when it comes to search engines. Google search maybe the first thing that pop-out in your head. It’s okay but let me tell you something. For several weeks, <a href="http://hyperplex.co/linked/2015/07/05/duckduckgo-bangs-search/">I’ve switched my search engines on my iPhone, iPad and Mac to DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo is listed as search engines in Safari along with Yahoo and Bing besides Google. Even the result page isn’t as intuitive as Google when it comes to search for news, DuckDuckGo’s result is pretty relevant and reliable.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong using Google as default search engine. I think we already know that Google track your search and click through your search. It’s their business. Google collect your data and monetize it, it’s no secret anymore. If you fine with it then you don’t need to finish reading this post.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo with its premises “The search engine that doesn’t track you” is just enough reason for me to switch over Google. Overmore you can optimize your search using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">prefix bang operators</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to search for Macbook Pro Retina on Amazon, you can use bang !a macbook pro retina at DuckDuckGo’s search bar and you’ll sent directly to <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> search result web page instead of DuckDuckGo’s result page. DuckDuckGo has thousands bang operators you can use and even you can submit your own bang to search directly on you site. Some of the popular bang you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>!w - <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></li>
  <li>!imdb - <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a></li>
  <li>!pin - <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></li>
  <li>!wa - <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a></li>
  <li>!imgur - <a href="https://www.imgur.com/">Imgur</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with the result, you can use !g bang to do Google search, the bonus is it doesn’t track you since you’re using <code>encrypted.google.com</code> for this search. There are several bang for another types Google Search, such as images, videos, calendar, etc too.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo’s website traffic has increased up to 600% for the last two years according the CEO, Gabe Weinberg on an interview with CNBC. As pointed out <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/16/duckduckgo-growth-ios/">by 9to5Mac</a>, there are variety factors for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/06/19/duckduckgo">the rise of DuckDuckGo</a>, NSA’s surveillance program and Apple listed them as search engine on iOS 8 and Safari 7.1 on Mac. I wonder how much they’ll growth if someday Apple make them as the default search engine replacing Google on iOS and Mac.</p>

<p>If you wondering how DuckDuckGo make money from its services, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3046943/how-duckduckgo-rode-a-wave-of-post-snowden-anxiety-to-massive-growth">John Paul Wiltow write on Fast Company</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of profiting from heaps of user data, DuckDuckGo has opted for a simpler business model: Old-school search ads that pair the keywords in people’s queries with relevant ads placed by the highest bidder. Weinberg says the company also makes money from affiliate links to sites like Amazon and eBay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s interesting data on John’s article, apparently 40% U.S adults don’t want the search engines to track what they search, based on Pew Research Center’s survey. John also pointed out that even it doesn’t monetize your click through web search, DuckDuckGo still make revenue which allow the company to hire a new people and mantain its sustainability.</p>

<p>So, let me courage you to switch to DuckDuckGo for a week first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two weeks ago, the same 84 percent figure was captured by Apple, indicating that the number of users who have upgraded from previous iOS editions to iOS 8, or bought a new device with iOS 8 pre-installed, wasn’t enough to move the needle.</p>

  <p>More interesting than that, however, is the latest data point by analysts Mixpanel which basically tells us that the recently-released iOS 8.4 software update now accounts for 40 percent of all iOS usage, just one week after release.</p>

<p>One can guarantee you when using an iOS devices is you can update to the latest version of iOS in day one after it’s released.</p>
