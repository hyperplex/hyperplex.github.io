Mike Beasley writings for 9to5Mac:

> This new feature will allow the operating system to intelligently delete applications if you donâ€™t have enough free space to perform a software update. Once the update is complete, the apps will automatically be reinstalled and your data will remain intact.

It's glad to hear this and know that Apple is still responsible for selling 16GB iOS device and make it less painful to use.
