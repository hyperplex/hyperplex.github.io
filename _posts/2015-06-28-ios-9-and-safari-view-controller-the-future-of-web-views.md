Federico Viticci on Macstories:

> With Safari View Controller, Apple is freeing many developers from the burden of writing browser components for their apps. "This is something developers have been asking for for years", Milham told me, and it's not hard to understand why. If an app's primary functionality isn't to display web content but still needs to occasionally present webpages, having to code a browser from scratch is a waste of precious time in most cases. Safari View Controller fixes this by bringing years of Safari evolution to every app. This is good for developers, who won't need to spend hours writing a decent browser from the ground up, and it's good for users, who will be able to rely on the power of Safari almost anywhere on iOS.

This is worth to read.
