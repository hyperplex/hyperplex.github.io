Apple has released a support documentation about two-factor authentication that will be built in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.
 
> Whenever you sign in with your Apple ID on a new device or browser, you will verify your identity by entering your password plus a six-digit verification code. The verification code will be displayed automatically on any Apple devices you are already signed in to that are running iOS 9 or OS X El Capitan. Just enter the code to complete sign in. If you donâ€™t have an Apple device handy, you can receive the code on your phone via a text message or phone call instead.
