From The Next Web:

> Where BlackBerry used to offer a ‘Timed and Retracted Control’ subscription, there’s now a Privacy and Control subscription that costs $0.99 per month. In addition to providing the timed sending and retraction of messages options, the plan also includes the new private chat feature and another new feature that allows you to edit a sent message by retracting it, editing it and then re-sending it.

From what it is, I guess they are trying so hard to make profit from its instant messaging services.
