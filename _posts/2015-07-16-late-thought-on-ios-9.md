Apple has announced [iOS 9](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios9-preview/). Focus on the optimizations and stability improvements Apple also add some features who boost functionality on iOS even some of the features they add such as trackpad mode on keyboard and picture in picture could be achieved with being jailbroken. For the last two years, Apple adds a lot of features on iOS which lesser the reason to jailbreak. The number of my installed tweak after being jailbroken is also lesser each new iOS version is released.

Some people said that Apple borrow ideas from jailbreak scenes and build it into their next iOS release. I still remember how iOS 7 adopt control center which back then on iOS 6 we could achieve that with tweaks named [SBSettings](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/sbsettings) and [NCSettings](http://modmyi.com/cydia/com.jamied360.ncsettings). [Nine features](http://www.iphonehacks.com/2013/06/ios-7-features-inspired-by-jailbreak-tweaks.html) Apple borrowed from jailbreak scene for iOS 7. 

On iOS 8, once again Apple adopt some of tweaks that extends some functionality on iOS which already present when you were jailbroken such as quick reply, third party keyboard, Notification Center widgets, Touch ID extensions to secure third party apps, and the [list go on.](http://www.redmondpie.com/ios-8-features-apple-copied-from-jailbreak-tweaks/)

iOS 9? They still did it. 

I wait for iOS 9 public beta and I installed it yesterday. I installed on my iPad Air and as beta software, there's bug and crash. Just a kindly reminder, don't install it on your primary devices to avoid data loss. Apple give iPad a lot of attention on iOS 9 and here's my thought about it: 

## Siri & Search

### Siri
Siri gets a new look in iOS 9, matched with Siri on Apple Watch interface. Proactive Siri, yes, the virtual assistant will try to predict what will you do next, seems scary? Don't worry, since Apple need to gather your datas to give personalize experience, you data never be uploaded to the cloud instead it stay in your device. It's yours. It's also good from user privacy and security standpoint.

### Search
Spotlight gets supercharged. You can now search using natural language just like talking to human. With deep and back links, search result will not always web page as the previous iOS version. 

On iOS 9 when you search for a restaurant and there's a result from Zomato, instead of opening Zomato's web you'll brought to search result page within Zomato app if installed. After you finish with what you're looking for, you can tap the label "Back to Search" on the top left side to back to the Spotlight search. 

Sadly, Apple will only allow official apps to use deep and back link. It means if you'll look for a person's Twitter profile, you'll brought to the official Twitter app and not the third party Twitter client your choice such as Tweetbot or Twitterrific.

## Notes

Notes get big overhaul in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. You can now insert photo, PDF files, videos, weblinks and more to make contents inside it richer than just rich text formatting. You can drag n drop to OS X El Capitan Notes apps to insert files. While on iOS, you can utilize share sheets. Not stopping there, you can doodling inside Notes app on iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. Apple also add sync and search features since it's tied to iCloud account. When you make a new note on iPhone, it'll available on all of your devices with the same iCloud accounts. Even it's not as advance as [Evernote](http://evernote.com/), yet, but finally Apple give attention to its Notes apps to shorten the gap with third party note taking apps. 

## Quicktype

Quicktype was the name of the keyboard Apple announced last year. On iOS 9, Apple optimize it. The most noticeable is now Apple visualize lower and uppercase on its keyboard, make it easier to know what case you'll type next. For a long time jailbroken iOS devices user, I've been use this features with the tweak called [ShowCase](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/jp.ashikase.showcase/). It's easier to see than to glance at the shift key[^fn1]. Apple also let you to disable the pop-up as you type on its keyboard. iPad will gain more benefit on iOS 9 as Apple optimize its keyboard, I'll tell you why:

### Shortcut and trackpads

On iPad, Apple add a new bar above the keyboard. Not just showing predictions about what will you type, it now also contains several button to let you cut, copy, paste to the left side. For formatting, Apple add shortcuts to bold, italic or underline selected text shortcut to the right side.

At least Apple granted my iOS 9 wishlist[^fn2] with bringing a features that allow user to move the cursor and select some text with just swiping over the keyboard. On jailbroken iOS devices, you can have this functionality by install [SwipeSelection](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.iky1e.swipeselection/) tweak. Maybe this is the reason why I still jailbreak my iOS devices. This tweak offers moving cursor just by swiping over the keyboard and you can select some text just by swipe from shift or backspace key. On iOS 9, Apple let you to move cursor by placing and swipe using two fingers on the keyboard. Even the implementation is little bit different but I'm happy that finally Apple bring this features.

Some sources said that it works on iPad only but I've been asked some people on Twitter that it works on iPhone too. Anyone confirm?

## Multitasking

Apple brings more advanced multitasking features on iPad with iOS 9. 
With the new multitasking features on iOS 9, Apple push iPad to become [primary computer for some people](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/). iOS 9 will boost iPad functionality than just consuming devices.

### Slide Over
Works on iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2, and iPad mini 3 it allows you to bring access to the second app without leaving the primary app you've opened. You can reply to your girlfriend's iMessages without need to leave Safari while reading or browsing something[^fn3]. Once you reply it, you can dismiss the Slide Over sidebar and continue reading or browsing or whatever you're currently doing. You just need to swipe from the right edge of the display just like as easy as accessing Control Center to invoke Slide Over. You can't interact with the primary app while accessing the app you open with Slide Over. 

### Split View

Available only for iPad Air 2, Split View features brings true multitasking to iPad which allow you to interact with two apps with the same time. It will be useful when you're doing research using Safari and Notes app side by side. The implementation doesn't feel intrusive at all. You have to own an iPad Air 2 with 2 GB RAM and Apple A8X processors. I wonder if someday iOS 9 is jailbreakable, would there'll be a tweak to enable Split View on older devices? Today on jailbreak world there's [Mirmir](http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=mirmirDp) tweak that bring multitasking further than iOS stocks today[^fn4]. With this tweak you can run 4 apps simultaneously on iPad. With Split View near in the future, I would like to see a tweak to enable it natively for older devices.

### Picture in Picture

In short words, you can now watch or stream videos in a floating window so you could browsing or tweeting at the same time. 

Meanwhile, [VideoPane](http://rpetri.ch/cydia/videopane/)

All of this multitasking on iOS 9 would give great benefit for iPad. With larger display, user can utilize it to do more than just stock iOS do pre iOS 9. Maybe Apple would give iPad a shot to become productivity tablet everyone should have because of the decreased number of sales. 

## Security 

6 digits passcode instead of 4, built in [2-factor authentication](https://developer.apple.com/support/two-factor-authentication/), Better App Transport Security, and a better approach to data operations which Apple doesn't following what competitors did by uploading personal data to the cloud to give personalize service. Apple store the data on the device and compute there so you don't have to worry about your personal data on Apple's server.

## Update to iOS 9

Updating to iOS 8 is sure a big problem, literally. You need almost 5GB empty space on your devices to perform OTA Update. However, iOS 9 will only need 1.3GB. Apple also offers to delete some apps if your empty space isn't sufficient to perform the update and reinstall it after the update is done. Overmore, there's a new technology Apple introduced with iOS 9 called [App Thinning](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH35) which is split into 3 different mechanisms that can reduce the size of an app. App slicing, On Demand Resources(ODRs) and Bitcode. You can read the explanation about how these three mechanisms work on [ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/06/app-thinning-will-be-a-major-boon-for-8gb-and-16gb-iphones-and-ipads/). They explained it in details and why it matters for iOS devices with 8GB and 16GB storage.

## So?

It's good to see that Apple slowly make iOS more open than it was, with third party keyboard, Touch ID API, Notification Center widgets, iOS is more customizeable than previous version. Make iOS more open is a story, balancing it with user privacy and security is another story. 

Nightmode, one features I wished that could change iOS color scheme to dark isn't delivered by Apple. The purpose of Nightmode is to make using iOS more pleasant to use at night. When you use iOS at night, our eyes become tired easily because of the mainly white color on iOS today, even when you've turned down the brightness into lowest point.

iOS 9 not just brings optimizations and stability improvements but also bunch of features that boost functionality, especially for iPad. With multitasking features and keyboard shortcut, Apple push iPad to become productivity tablet without intention to replacing Mac. 

[^fn1]: Which is confusing and Apple takes a long time to fix it

[^fn2]: It's my old website that talks about tech before this site is up, I'll just let it there. You know, memories, archives or whatever you called it

[^fn3]: Win-win solution, huh?!
