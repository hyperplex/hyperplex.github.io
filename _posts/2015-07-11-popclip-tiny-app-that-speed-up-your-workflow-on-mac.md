If you're an iOS user, you've already know that when you select some text there will be a tiny pop-up with various menu that usually let you cut, copy, define or even speak that selected text. In iOS mail app the pop-up menu also lets you insert a photo or attachment. In [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&at=1010lDx&ct=hy), you can look up for a word you select in Terminology if installed using the pop-up menu. However when working on Mac, there's no such functionality you can use by default. But don't worry, there's an app for that, it's called [PopClip](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/popclip/id445189367?at=1010lDx)

PopClip mimic pop-up action menu on iOS. So after you install PopClip and select some text, there will be a pop-up menu that allow you to do various task with your selected text. You can save your selected text on Evernote, nvALT. If you're have an appointment on your email, you can select and send it to Fantastical. Where does this magic live?

There are extensions that make PopClip powerful. PopClip has [hundreds extensions](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions) from manipulating text, translate it, count the words from selected text till make a new to do task on Todoist[^fn1] or any task management apps you use. If you can't find one, why you're not [build for yourself?](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions). Here's the screenshot of PopClip extensions I use:

With [$3.99](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/popclip/id445189367?at=1010lDx) asking price (for a limited time), PopClip is tiny app that will speed up your workflow on Mac.
