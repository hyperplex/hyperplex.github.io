[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2015/07/26/dont-order-the-fish):

> iTunes is designed by the Junk Drawer Method: when enough cruft has built up that somebody tells the team to redesign it, while also adding and heavily promoting these great new features in the UI that are really important to the company’s other interests and are absolutely non-negotiable, the only thing they can really do is hide all of the old complexity in new places.

> With the introduction of Apple Music, Apple confusingly introduced a confusing service backed by the iTunes Store that’s confusingly integrated into iTunes and the iOS Music app (don’t even get me started on that) and partially, maybe, mostly replaces the also very confusing and historically unreliable iTunes Match.

[Jim Dalrymple loss his music library](http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/07/22/apple-music-is-a-nightmare-and-im-done-with-it/) after Apple Music is launched to public. I never thought that Apple would get into this trouble before. I expected that Apple Music would be a great replacement of Spotify which I use before. Eventhough I'm not losing my music library, I have bad experience with Apple Music. 

This bad experience happens on iOS Music app. When I find a great playlist as suggested by Apple Music, I added them to my playlist collection but it showed nothing. There's no songs on that playlist, even there's no playlist cover as seen on search result. Next, I tried to create my own playlist based on my favorite songs of various artist. I created the playlist and go to the For You tab. I searched various songs and add them on the newly created playlist around 30 songs. But, again, it showed no songs. Bad. Pretty Bad.

I know the purpose of baking Apple Music with iOS music apps but pardon me, can I categorize it as bloated software now? The interaction is confusing and there's to many menu. Similarly with iTunes and I agree with Macro Arment on his blog post. I would love to see a new app, a standalone app for Apple Music on Mac. 

Messing up with personal stuff like musics or photos is indeed a terrible idea. If Apple do a great job with Photos app on Mac, why not taking the same path for Apple Music?
