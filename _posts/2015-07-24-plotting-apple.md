Dr. Drang has interesting takes on plotting Apple's sales and revenue using Python/ Matplotlib code:

> Every data point in the graph (except for the first three for each device) represents an average of the sales for four quarters: the current quarter and the previous three. The idea behind the averaging is to smooth out the strongly seasonal ups and downs in the raw quarterly data.
