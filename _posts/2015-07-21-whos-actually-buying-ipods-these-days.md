Sometimes we need to see some things from different perspective and Matt Birchler shared to us who actually buy iPod these days as he worked managing electronic departement at target.

Matt Birchler:

> So who are iPods for? They're for people who don't have a smartphone, and that's about it. This makes complete sense, though. The smartphone came in and ate so many products' lunch. Apple's iPhone can do everything these iPods can do and do so much more as well. A smartphone is almost essential if you're a young to middle age adult these days, so you probably already have one in your pocket. For that majority of the population, iPods are redundant, and they don't even think about them most of the time.
>
> iPods remain somewhat relevant amongst the very young and very old. But once again, the rise of affordable tablets has made even those markets shrink by the day. It's hard to think the iPod line is going to do anything but continue shrink even with this refresh.

I remember back when I got my first iPod Touch 4G on 2011. It's beautiful device even the back scratch so easily. I purchased it for mostly played games and dumped my music collections there. It's great device to killing time but with now iPhone take the world and large screen iPad become more affordable, it just the matter of time till Apple kill the iPod line up. Or maybe I'm wrong.
