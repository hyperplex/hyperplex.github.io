Federico Viticci's on Macstories:

> Features like browser tabs, folding, custom templates, preview themes, and better search make Editorial the undisputed king of Markdown text editing on iOS – an area where no other app can compete at this point. I would like to see a faster release cycle from Zorn – hopefully adopting iOS 9 multitasking and search won't take long – but that doesn't change the fact that Editorial continues to be the most powerful app for writing and automating Markdown on iOS – for [all the reasons I covered in the past](http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/).

If you write a lot and need a powerful text editor on iOS then read Viticci's review of Editorial. An instant buy.
